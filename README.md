# Income Expense Tracker

A fully functional Income Expense Calculator created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project implements complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to manage financial entries and uses `localStorage` to persist data across browser sessions.

## üöÄ Features

* **Add Transactions:** Add new income or expense entries with a description and amount.
* **Edit Transactions:** Update the description, amount, or type of any existing entry.
* **Delete Transactions:** Remove any entry from the list.
* **Dynamic Summary:** Automatically calculates and displays Total Income, Total Expense, and Net Balance.
* **Transaction Filtering:** Filter the history list to show "All", "Income" only, or "Expense" only.
* **Data Persistence:** All transactions are saved to the browser's `localStorage`, so your data is saved even after you close the tab.
* **Form Reset:** A "Reset" button clears the form fields and cancels an edit operation.
* **Responsive Design:** The layout is clean and functional on both desktop and mobile devices.
